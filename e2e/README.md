# E2E (Playwright)

Browser-driven end-to-end tests for DXKB V2. Complements the 134 Vitest files under `src/**` — Vitest still covers units, hooks, contexts, API routes, and auth internals. Playwright covers what jsdom can't: real browser rendering across Chromium/Firefox/WebKit, multi-page journeys with real cookies, file upload/drag-drop, 3D viewers, and visual regressions.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm e2e                       # Run all specs against all three browsers
pnpm e2e --project=chromium    # Run one browser
pnpm e2e:ui                    # Open Playwright UI runner
pnpm e2e:debug                 # Open the inspector
pnpm e2e:codegen               # Record selectors against a running app
pnpm e2e:report                # Open last HTML report
pnpm e2e:update-snapshots      # Regenerate visual baselines
pnpm e2e:record <journey>      # Record a HAR against live backend (manual, local only)
```

The suite runs against a **production build** on port `3020` (independent from `pnpm dev` on 3019 and `pnpm start` on 3010). Playwright's `webServer` config starts `next start -p 3020` automatically; it does **not** build the app for you. Run `pnpm build` before `pnpm e2e` after any source change. The `pnpm e2e` script in `package.json` wires this together; CI runs `pnpm build` as a separate workflow step for the same reason.

Override the port with `E2E_PORT=3030 pnpm e2e --project=chromium`. The wrapper substitutes `${E2E_PORT}` in every backend URL in `.env.e2e.test` so server-side fetches still reach the correct loopback mock.

## Mocking strategy

All `/api/**` and outbound HTTPS to `*.patricbrc.org`, `*.bv-brc.org`, `*.theseed.org`, `*.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov` are mocked. Three layers (registered into the Playwright routing stack in this order so LIFO precedence gives overrides the first shot):

1. **JSON overrides** (`e2e/fixtures/overrides/*`) — hand-written responses. Highest precedence.
2. **HAR replay** (`page.routeFromHAR`) — recorded traffic. Runs after overrides via `notFound: "fallback"`.
3. **Strict guard** — any backend request not matched by the above is aborted with `route.abort("failed")` and logged as `[applyBackendMocks/strict]` to the test output.

Non-backend requests (Next.js assets, fonts, CDN) always pass through regardless of strict mode.

Call `applyBackendMocks(page, { overrides, har? })` in a `beforeEach`. **Strict is the default.** If you genuinely need to let real backend calls through for an exploratory test, pass `strict: false`.

The permissive catch-all `permissiveBackendOverrides` (from `e2e/fixtures/overrides`) covers `/api/auth/`, `/api/services/`, `/api/workspace/`, and the four backend hosts with generic 200 responses — use it as the last spread in your override list for the "I just want the page to render" case, after specific fixtures.

### Server-side backends: loopback isolation

`page.route()` only intercepts *browser* requests. Server components and API route handlers make their own outbound fetches to `APP_SERVICE_URL`, `WORKSPACE_API_URL`, `USER_URL`, etc. before the page is streamed, and those fetches bypass Playwright entirely — previously they failed with "JSON-RPC call failed: HTTP error! status: 500" and flooded the webServer log on every render.

To fix this the test server runs through a wrapper that seeds the right env vars before Next starts:

- **`e2e/scripts/start-webserver.mjs`** is what `playwright.config.ts`'s `webServer.command` launches. It resolves the port (CLI arg > `E2E_PORT` > `3020`), then reads `.env.e2e.local` (optional) followed by `.env.e2e.test` (required) via `node:util`'s `parseEnv`, merging each key into `process.env` under `node --env-file=` semantics (existing values win). Values can reference `${E2E_PORT}`; the wrapper substitutes the resolved port at load time so the committed file stays port-agnostic. Finally it spawns `next start -p <port>` — it does **not** run `next build`, because a cold build exceeds Playwright's webServer timeout and blocks targeted runs. Run `pnpm build` yourself first. We can't just use `node --env-file=` here because that flag leaks into `NODE_OPTIONS` and Next's build worker threads reject `NODE_OPTIONS` containing `--env-file` (`ERR_WORKER_INVALID_EXEC_ARGV`).
- **`.env.e2e.test`** (committed, loaded by the wrapper) points every backend URL at a loopback mock: `http://127.0.0.1:${E2E_PORT}/api/e2e-mock/<service>`.
- **`.env.e2e.local`** (gitignored, loaded by the wrapper if present) is for local-only overrides. Because the wrapper loads `.env.e2e.local` **before** `.env.e2e.test`, any key set in the local file wins over the committed default. A shell-exported variable beats both.
- **`src/app/api/e2e-mock/[...path]/route.ts`** answers those loopback requests. `GET → 200 {}`, `POST → 200 {"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":[[]]}`. Hits are logged as `[api/e2e-mock] <METHOD> /<path>` so fixtures can be promoted into overrides later.
- The handler is guarded by `E2E_MOCK_ENABLED=1` (set in `.env.e2e.test`). Without that flag every handler returns 404, so a production build that somehow shipped this file can't serve fake data.

If you add a new server-side backend dependency, add its env var to `.env.e2e.test` pointing at `/api/e2e-mock/<something>`. No code changes needed beyond that.

## Page objects

`e2e/pages/` holds thin wrappers around the selectors and interactions for each major page. Import from `../pages` and drive the page through the wrapper rather than re-finding selectors in every spec:

```ts
import { SignInPage } from "../pages";

const signIn = new SignInPage(page);
await signIn.goto("/workspace");          // goto with optional redirect=
await signIn.fill(username, password);
await signIn.submit();
await signIn.expectInlineError(/invalid/i);
```

Add a new page object when a spec starts repeating the same selector tuple twice, not preemptively — the wrappers are meant to encode the actual shape of the page, not a speculative surface.

## Recording a HAR

`pnpm e2e:record <journey>` captures real backend traffic into `e2e/fixtures/hars/<journey>.har`. Specs replay the HAR via `applyBackendMocks(page, { har, overrides })` so they assert against the real BV-BRC response shape rather than hand-maintained mocks. Two recording modes:

**Scripted (preferred — used by the bi-weekly refresh workflow):** drop a driver at `e2e/scripts/journeys/<name>.ts` exporting `drive(page, env)` (see `e2e/scripts/journeys/README.md`). The recorder runs it headless against `E2E_RECORD_BASE_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:3010`, the production build). Use this when you want determinism — the same driver records the same flow every time, which is what makes the cron'd refresh meaningful.

**Interactive (one-off exploration):** if no driver file exists for the journey name, the recorder launches a headed Chromium and waits for you to drive the flow manually, then press Enter.

Steps:

1. `cp .env.e2e.example .env.e2e` and fill in valid BV-BRC creds (gitignored — never commit).
2. `pnpm build && pnpm start` — recording requires the production build because `pnpm dev` (Turbopack) injects HMR plumbing that blocks React hydration in headless Chromium, leaving the auth boundary stuck in `loading`.
3. `pnpm e2e:record auth-sign-in` (or your journey name).
4. The recorder filters non-backend traffic (skips `_next/static`, fonts, images), scrubs the live username/password/email out of all bodies, and rewrites the recorded host to `http://e2e-har-replay.local`. `applyBackendMocks` swaps that placeholder back to the active app host at replay time, so HARs are port-portable across `E2E_PORT` values.
5. Commit the resulting `.har`. Re-record when the API contract drifts; the bi-weekly cron does this automatically (see below).

### Wiring a HAR into a spec

Two integration modes — pick the one that matches what the spec is asserting.

**Auth-shape contract test (`{ har }` option).** Routes the entire recorded HAR through `page.routeFromHAR`. Matching is strict: URL + HTTP method, plus an exact POST-payload comparison for POSTs, with header similarity as the tiebreaker when multiple entries match the same key. Use this when the spec drives the recorded auth flow itself and just asserts the sign-in response shape (drift canary against contract changes) — strict-body matching is fine here because the spec replays the same payload bytes the recorder captured. `auth.spec.ts` is the canonical example.

```ts
await applyBackendMocks(page, {
  har: "auth-sign-in.har",
  // Skip `permissiveBackendOverrides` for routes the HAR covers — overrides
  // run before HAR replay (LIFO route registration), so a permissive override
  // would intercept and return `{}` before the HAR served the recorded body.
  overrides: [],
});
```

**Body-aware journey replay (`harOverridesFor` helper).** Reads the HAR file and emits one `JsonOverride` per `(path, method, JSON-RPC method)` tuple, with `matchBody` fanning the JSON-RPC entry point out by request `method` field. Sequential entries that share a tuple replay in HAR order via the override's `callIndex` body function — so a `Workspace.ls` recorded twice (pre- and post-upload) replays correctly. Use this when the spec drives a signed-in journey (workspace listing, file viewer, jobs page, service form) and asserts on UI rendered from the recorded post-auth payloads.

```ts
import { harOverridesFor } from "../scripts/har-overrides";

await applyBackendMocks(page, {
  overrides: [
    // Layered first so the AuthBoundary's hydration refresh sees a signed-in
    // user. Without this, the HAR's pre-sign-in `/api/auth/get-session` entry
    // (recorded before sign-in fired) would return `{user:null}` and the
    // ProtectedRouteGuard would redirect to /sign-in.
    ...authSessionOverrides,
    ...harOverridesFor("workspace-browse.har"),
    // Mops up anything the HAR didn't capture (future code paths) so strict
    // mode doesn't fail the test on an unrelated unmocked request.
    ...permissiveBackendOverrides,
  ],
});

// Recorded paths key off the realm the recorder authenticated against (`bvbrc`),
// not the mocked-cookie realm (`patricbrc.org`). Match the recorded path so the
// workspace browser's outbound RPC calls land on the recorded entries; cookies
// just satisfy the middleware existence check.
await page.goto(`/workspace/${encodeURIComponent("e2e-test-user@bvbrc")}/home`);
```

`harOverridesFor` matches on `pathname + search`, so the host-placeholder rewrite (`http://e2e-har-replay.local`) is irrelevant — the override matcher does a substring `includes` check against the live request URL. Status and response headers are taken from the first entry of each group; if a journey needs status drift across same-key calls, layer hand-rolled overrides on top.

### Bi-weekly refresh

`.github/workflows/e2e-har-refresh.yml` runs the scripted recorders against the live backend on a fortnightly cron and opens a `chore(e2e): refresh recorded HARs` PR if any HAR diffed. Real shape changes (new fields, renamed keys, status drift) surface as a normal review; pure timestamp churn merges as-is. Required secrets: `E2E_TEST_USER`, `E2E_TEST_PASSWORD`, `E2E_HAR_REFRESH_TOKEN` (PAT with `contents:write` + `pull-requests:write`).

The workflow has two matrix groups:

- **read-only** (cron + manual dispatch): `auth-sign-in`, `workspace-browse`, `workspace-viewer`, `jobs-lifecycle`, `service-submit`. Nothing writes to the test account.
- **write** (manual dispatch with `include_write: true` only): `workspace-upload`. Each refresh creates a new file under `home/.e2e-records/` on the test account, so we keep this off the cron.

Each group opens its own PR (`chore/e2e-har-refresh-read-only` / `chore/e2e-har-refresh-write`). Some journeys depend on seeded fixtures on the test account — see [`e2e/scripts/journeys/README.md`](./scripts/journeys/README.md) for the catalogue and seeding requirements.

## Visual regression

Baselines live in `e2e/__snapshots__/`, one per `(spec, browser, platform)` triple. Chromium is strict (zero-pixel diff). Firefox and WebKit allow `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.05` to absorb font/AA differences.

We commit both `*-linux.png` (for CI on `ubuntu-latest`) and `*-darwin.png` (for local Macs) so visual tests work out of the box on both. Windows contributors regenerate their own `*-win32.png` locally and are not expected to commit them.

### Regenerate on macOS

For intentional UI changes, first refresh your local (Darwin) baselines:

```bash
pnpm e2e:update-snapshots
git add e2e/__snapshots__
```

### Regenerate Linux baselines (for CI)

**Preferred — pull from a failing CI run.** Open a PR with your UI change, let the e2e job fail on the visual diff, then download the actuals and commit them:

```bash
# Find the failed run id for your PR
gh run list --workflow="E2E (Playwright)" --branch=<your-branch> --limit 1

# Download all artifacts
gh run download <run-id> --dir /tmp/dxkb-ci

# Copy actuals into the baseline dir (adjust page/browser to match what failed)
DEST=e2e/__snapshots__/tests/visual/visual.spec.ts-snapshots
for B in chromium firefox webkit; do
  for P in home sign-in workspace genome-assembly jobs; do
    ACTUAL=$(find /tmp/dxkb-ci/playwright-report-$B -type d -name "*-snapshot-$B" \
      -exec find {} -name "$P-actual.png" \; 2>/dev/null | head -1)
    [ -n "$ACTUAL" ] && cp "$ACTUAL" "$DEST/$P-$B-linux.png"
  done
done

git add e2e/__snapshots__
```

This is the only way to get byte-exact parity with GitHub Actions runners.

**Do not** use `docker run --platform linux/amd64 mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:X-noble …` on Apple Silicon. QEMU emulation produces ~20-24 px height differences and ~6% pixel drift vs native amd64, which busts chromium's zero-tolerance. The image works on a native amd64 host (EC2, GitHub Codespaces) if you have one.

Review the PNG diffs in the PR before merging.

## Browser matrix

Every PR runs three jobs via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/pnpm-e2e.yml`): chromium, firefox, webkit. Each shard caches its own browser binary in `~/.cache/ms-playwright`. Reports upload as artifacts on failure.

## Agents: driving the app interactively

Two paths, depending on what the agent needs to do.

**Playwright MCP (preferred for exploration)** — the `plugin:playwright` MCP server is available in this repo's Claude sessions:

```text
1. Start the dev server:  pnpm dev
2. Use browser_navigate:  http://localhost:3019
3. Use browser_snapshot, browser_click, browser_type, etc.
```

**Pnpm scripts (for running the suite)** — use the `pnpm e2e*` commands above from a Bash tool.

## Cross-cutting specs

**`a11y.spec.ts`** — runs `@axe-core/playwright` on home, sign-in, workspace, the genome-assembly form, and jobs, plus a dedicated check on the open command palette dialog. Fails on `serious` or `critical` violations; logs `moderate`/`minor` ones via `console.warn`. After DXKBCORE-133 the `knownBaselineViolations` allowlist is `[]`; only add IDs back with a linked ticket and a target removal date.

**`viewer-3d.spec.ts`** — drives `/viewer/structure/<path>`, mocks `/api/workspace/view/...` with a minimal one-atom PDB, and asserts the page chrome + Mol* container render. The full WebGL canvas-paint assertion is gated on Mol*'s own runtime probe — if Mol* surfaces "WebGL does not seem to be available" (e.g. headless Chromium without GPU), the paint test self-skips. Firefox and WebKit are skipped wholesale because their headless WebGL stacks are unreliable.

**`search-keyboard.spec.ts`** — covers two complementary keyboard surfaces. The navbar `SearchBar` journey: type → Enter → routed to `/search?q=...&searchtype=everything`, empty submission stays put, clipboard paste fills the input (Chromium only; Firefox / WebKit headless clipboard permissions are unreliable). The global `<CommandPalette>` mounted in the root layout: `Cmd/Ctrl+K` opens the dialog, ArrowDown + Enter routes to a navigation item, typing a query + Enter routes to `/search`, Esc closes, and clipboard paste fills the palette input.

## When to add a Playwright test vs a Vitest test

- **Vitest** for: pure functions, hooks, contexts, API route handlers, components that render fine in jsdom.
- **Playwright** for: multi-page flows, real-cookie auth, file upload, drag/drop, 3D viewer, iframes, CSS/layout regressions, cross-browser parity.

If a single render-and-assert test would pass in jsdom, keep it in Vitest. Playwright is for journeys and browser-level truth.
