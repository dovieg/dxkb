# Testing Rules

## Node Version

Tests require **Node.js >= 22** (vitest 4.x / rolldown needs `node:util#styleText`). The project targets **Node v24**. Use `nvm use 24` (or the `.nvmrc` if present) before running any commands.

## Test Runner

The project uses **Vitest 4** with jsdom environment. Config lives in `vitest.config.mts`, setup in `vitest.setup.ts`.

```bash
pnpm test             # Run all tests once (vitest run)
pnpm test:watch       # Watch mode
pnpm test:coverage    # Run with V8 coverage
```

## Coverage

V8 coverage with floor thresholds enforced by `pnpm test:coverage` (see `vitest.config.mts`):

| Metric | Floor |
|---|---|
| lines | 81 |
| statements | 80 |
| functions | 84 |
| branches | 70 |

- Floors sit just below the measured baseline so unrelated PRs don't trip on rounding drift. Bump them upward when new tests raise the measured numbers; never lower them.
- Scope: `src/lib/**`, `src/hooks/**`, `src/contexts/**`, `src/app/api/**`, `src/app/services/page.tsx`. Excludes `src/components/ui/**`, `*.d.ts`, and `types.ts` / `types/**`.
- Reporters: `text`, `html`, `json-summary`, `json` (HTML report at `coverage/index.html`).

## CI / GitHub Actions

Four workflows run automatically on every PR targeting `main`:

| Workflow | File | Command |
|---|---|---|
| Lint | `.github/workflows/pnpm-lint.yml` | `pnpm lint` |
| Typecheck | `.github/workflows/pnpm-typecheck.yml` | `pnpm typecheck` |
| Build | `.github/workflows/pnpm-build.yml` | `pnpm build` |
| Test | `.github/workflows/pnpm-test.yml` | `pnpm test` |

All four must pass before merging. `pnpm typecheck` runs `tsc --noEmit` and catches TS errors in test files that `pnpm build` skips.

## Test Before Committing

Before committing any changes, run the following commands locally to catch errors before CI does:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

## Test Conventions

- Test files live in `__tests__/` directories next to the source they cover (e.g. `src/lib/__tests__/utils.test.ts`).
- Use `vi.mock()` for module mocks. Do not reference variables declared with `const`/`let` inside a `vi.mock` factory — vitest hoists the factory above all imports, so the variable will not be initialized yet. Instead, import the mocked module inside the test and access its mock there.
- Prefer `expect.objectContaining()` over non-null assertions (`!`) to satisfy the `@typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion` rule.
- Globals (`describe`, `it`, `expect`, `vi`) are available without importing (configured via `globals: true`).

## Shared Test Helpers

`src/test-helpers/` contains the building blocks shared across the unit suite — prefer these over hand-rolling per-test:

- `msw-server.ts` — Shared MSW server (see "Mocking HTTP Requests with MSW" below).
- `api-route-helpers.ts`:
  - `mockNextRequest({ method, url, body, headers, searchParams })` — Build a `NextRequest` for route handler tests. Use this instead of `new Request(...)` or hand-rolling Next internals.
  - `createQueryClientWrapper()` — `QueryClientProvider` wrapper (with `retry: false`) for `renderHook` and React tests that touch TanStack Query.
  - `makeRouteContext(id)` — Build the `{ params: Promise<…> }` second argument for App Router route handlers.
  - `json(res)` — Tiny `res.json()` shorthand.

See `src/app/api/auth/profile/__tests__/route.test.ts` for a representative usage.

## Mocking HTTP Requests with MSW

Use [MSW (Mock Service Worker)](https://mswjs.io/docs/) to intercept HTTP requests in tests — do **not** use `vi.mock()` to mock functions like `fetch` or `serverAuthenticatedFetch`. MSW intercepts at the network level, which exercises the real request code paths (headers, serialization, error handling).

- A shared MSW server is configured in `src/test-helpers/msw-server.ts` with lifecycle hooks in `vitest.setup.ts` (strict mode — unhandled requests error).
- Use `server.use()` inside individual tests to add request handlers. Handlers are automatically reset after each test via `afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers())`.
- For server-side code that depends on `next/headers` cookies (e.g. `getSession`, `getAuthToken`, `serverAuthenticatedFetch`), mock `next/headers` with a `mockCookieStore` via `vi.hoisted()` to control auth state, and let the real functions run so their `fetch()` calls hit MSW:

```ts
const { mockCookieStore } = vi.hoisted(() => ({
  mockCookieStore: { get: vi.fn(), set: vi.fn() },
}));

vi.mock("next/headers", () => ({
  cookies: vi.fn(() => Promise.resolve(mockCookieStore)),
}));
```

- Set env vars (e.g. `process.env.USER_URL`) in `beforeEach` / `afterEach` instead of mocking `getRequiredEnv`.
- See `src/lib/auth/__tests__/session.test.ts` and `src/app/api/auth/profile/__tests__/route.test.ts` for reference examples.

## Linting Rules

- All variables and constants use `camelCase` — including module-level `const` exports. Do not use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants (that is a C/Java convention, not TypeScript/JavaScript).
- The only exceptions are environment variable names (OS convention) and zod schema objects which conventionally use camelCase anyway.
- Do not use `//eslint-disable` comments, fix the code instead. If you absolutely must use them, add a comment explaining why.

## Playwright (E2E) Rules

### Scope

- E2E specs live under `/e2e/tests/**`. One spec file per route family; visual-regression specs under `/e2e/tests/visual/`.
- Do **not** add Playwright tests that duplicate Vitest coverage (auth route handlers, hooks, contexts, units). Reserve Playwright for: multi-page browser journeys, cross-browser parity, and jsdom-impossible interactions (file upload, drag/drop, 3D viewer).
- Accessibility sweeps run via axe-core (`e2e/tests/a11y.spec.ts`) — extend that spec when adding routes that need a11y coverage rather than spreading axe checks across journey specs.
- Before committing: `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm build && pnpm test && pnpm e2e --project=chromium` for a fast local check (full three-browser matrix runs in CI).

### Page Objects

Specs interact with the app through page objects in `e2e/pages/` (e.g. `SignInPage`, `WorkspacePage`, `ServiceFormPage`, `JobsListPage`). New specs should add or extend a page object rather than embedding raw selectors. Each page object is a thin wrapper exposing `goto()`, semantic actions (`signIn()`, `uploadFile()`, etc.), and assertions — keep it focused on the page's surface, not test logic.

### Setup Projects + Storage State

`playwright.config.ts` defines two setup projects that run before browser projects:

- `setup-signed-in` (`e2e/auth/signed-in.setup.ts`) — Authenticates and writes `e2e/.auth/user.json`. The `chromium`, `firefox`, and `webkit` projects depend on it and load that storage state by default.
- `setup-public` (`e2e/auth/public.setup.ts`) — Empty storage state for unauthenticated specs.

Specs that must run logged-out should override with `test.use({ storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] } })` (or the public storage path) at the top of the spec.

### Backend Mocking

Two layers, both required for full isolation:

1. **Browser-side** — `applyBackendMocks(page, { har, overrides })` from `e2e/mocks/backends.ts` intercepts requests made from the page via `page.route()`.
2. **Server-side (loopback)** — Server components and route handlers fetch through env vars (e.g. `APP_SERVICE_URL`) that `.env.e2e.test` rewrites to `http://127.0.0.1:${E2E_PORT}/api/e2e-mock/<service>`. The loopback handler at `src/app/api/e2e-mock/[...path]/route.ts` serves the same HARs/overrides. Playwright's `page.route()` cannot see server-side fetches, so this layer is mandatory — without it, RSC/route-handler fetches make real outbound calls.

Because of the env-loading dance, the Playwright `webServer` runs `node e2e/scripts/start-webserver.mjs ${port}` instead of `next start` directly. Run `pnpm build` before `pnpm e2e` (the wrapper does not rebuild).

### HAR Replay Modes

- **Strict replay** — Pass a HAR path to `applyBackendMocks` and matching requests are served verbatim. Used for read-only journeys (e.g. `auth.spec.ts`).
- **Body-aware journey replay** — Use `harOverridesFor(journey, { callIndex })` from `e2e/scripts/har-overrides.ts` when the same endpoint must return different bodies across sequential calls (e.g. workspace mutations that reflect uploads/folder creation in subsequent reads). See `e2e/tests/workspace-actions.spec.ts`.
- HAR files live in `e2e/fixtures/hars/` (committed). Record with `pnpm e2e:record <journey>` against a real backend (local only — never in CI).
- Hand-written overrides live in `e2e/fixtures/overrides/` and run before HAR replay.

### Snapshots

- Chromium: strict (zero-pixel diff).
- Firefox / WebKit: `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.05`.
- Update baselines via `pnpm e2e:update-snapshots` and review PNG diffs in the PR.
- Snapshots are platform-specific — committed PNGs are suffixed `-darwin` or `-linux`. `pnpm e2e:update-snapshots` only writes baselines for the host OS, so a Mac can only refresh the `-darwin` set; the `-linux` set is normally regenerated in CI.

#### Refreshing `-linux` baselines locally (Mac → Linux)

When you need to update `-linux` PNGs from a Mac (e.g. UI changes touched the navbar or home page and you want the diff visible in the PR rather than waiting on CI), run Playwright inside the official Linux image. Match the image tag to the installed `@playwright/test` version:

```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION=$(pnpm exec playwright --version | awk '{print $2}')

# One-time: named volumes isolate the container's Linux node_modules + .next
# from your local darwin install so you don't clobber either side.
docker volume create dxkb-linux-nm
docker volume create dxkb-linux-next

docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd):/work" \
  -v dxkb-linux-nm:/work/node_modules \
  -v dxkb-linux-next:/work/.next \
  -w /work \
  -e CI=true \
  -e WORKSPACE_GUIDE_URL="https://www.bv-brc.org/docs/quick_references/workspace_groups_upload.html" \
  "mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v${PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION}-jammy" \
  bash -c "npm install -g pnpm@10 && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm build && pnpm e2e:update-snapshots --grep 'visual regression'"
```

- The source is bind-mounted at `/work`, so regenerated PNGs land back in `e2e/__snapshots__/` on the host. `node_modules` and `.next` live in named volumes — your darwin build/deps stay intact.
- `WORKSPACE_GUIDE_URL` mirrors the value set in `.github/workflows/pnpm-e2e.yml`; without it, server components on `/workspace/[username]/**` throw at request time.
- Drop `--grep 'visual regression'` to refresh every spec's snapshots, not just the visual ones.
- Playwright only rewrites a PNG when the new screenshot exceeds the project's `maxDiffPixelRatio` — expect Firefox/WebKit baselines on visually-minor changes to stay untouched.
- Reusing the volumes on subsequent runs skips most of the install/build cost. Cleanup when you're done: `docker volume rm dxkb-linux-nm dxkb-linux-next`.
